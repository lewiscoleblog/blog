    "# \"Barnes-Hut Algorithm\"\n",
    "> \"In this blog post we will cover some of the basics of the Barnes Hut algorithm. This is completely new to me, it is not an algorithm I've used/studied before (and I am by no means an astrophysicist). Nonetheless it has piqued my interest so I have decided to write about it. In this blog I will be talking about 2 dimensions unless otherwise stated, this just makes the resulting code run a little quicker and output easier to visualise. Modifying the 2d code to be 3d (or even higher dimension) requires only minor revisions.\"\n",

    "## The N-Body Problem\n",
    "It is well understood that for $N > 2$ that the problem of determining trajectories under gravitation for N-bodies cannot be solved analytically. Instead we must rely on computation to create trajectories. From Newton's equations we can write the force $\\pmb{F_{i,j}}$ between two bodies $i, j$ with masses $m_i, m_j$ and positions $\\pmb{p_i}, \\pmb{p_j}$ as:\n",
    "$$ \\pmb{F_{i,j}} = \\frac{G m_i m_j (\\pmb{p_i} - \\pmb{p_j})} {\\lVert \\pmb{p_i} - \\pmb{p_j} \\rVert^3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For $N$ bodies we therefore have $\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ forces to be calculated. For small $N$ this is not a problem, however if we want to model galaxy dynamics with thousands (or more) of bodies this becomes a computational issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Barnes Hut Process\n",
    "With Barnes Hut we can move from $O(N^2)$ complexity to $O(Nln(N))$ - this is a significant improvement for large $N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The crux of the Barnes Hut scheme is to approximate the effect of \"far away\" bodies but calculate exactly the forces attributed to \"near\" bodies. To do this a quadtree data structure is used (in 3d an octree or higher dimensions a $2^d$tree). To do this the space is partitioned into 4 equal squares at depth 1 (or 8 cubes in 3d or $2^d$ hypercubes in higher dimension) - at depth 2 each of these squares is then partitioned into 4 equal squares and so on. From this a tree is constructed with each node representing the number of bodies within the quadrant at that depth. This is repeated recursively until a depth is reached where each quadrant has 1 or 0 bodies in it. It is easier to understand this with a visual example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/lewiscoleblog/blog/raw/master/images/barnes-hut/Quadtree.png)\n",
    "(Source: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gkquadtree)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this data structure in place we can begin to simulate. For each quadrant in the quadtree we can calculate a centre of mass (in the obvious way). Then given a body we can calculate the force acting on it from a given quadrant by applying the Newtonian force calculation using the centre of mass. We could, for example, apply this to the 4 quadrants at depth 1 to approximate the force acting on the body. This of course might not be particularly accurate if there are many bodies present. To overcome this the Barnes Hut algorithm specifies a critical distance $\\theta$ if the distance beween the body and the centre of mass of the quadrant is greater than $\\theta$ then it is used as an approximation, if not the algorithm moves to the next depth of the quadtree and tries again, this happens recursively until the distance becomes below $\\theta$ or there is only 1 body in the quadrant (as such setting $\\theta = 0$ returns to the $O(N^2)$ brute force approach).\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is presented as an algorithm for the N-body problem it can be used in other situations that involve a spatial dimension and many entities. I am currently considering an application to speed up an agent based model (potentially the subject of another blog post).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "Initially I will code up an example in Python, I may revisit this and create a more efficient implementation in Cython/C++/etc. I will ignore all \"complications\" for example I will not give each body a size nor will it consider collisions, etc. Each body is a \"point mass\" in this example. For now I'll also ignore the issues relating to plotting trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first create a node class to represent nodes within the quadtree. Using this data structure we will then apply a verlet time step to calculate positions:"

    "We have seen that even for relatively modest models the Barnes-Hut algorithm provides fairly efficient computation for the N-body problem. We would expect the improvement to be even more marked for larger models. However Python on its own is not the best place to implement this and a C++ implementation would offer better performance. With some work a Cython approach should be possible and offer performance improvements. The code would require some major re-working if Numba is to be used instead owing to the reliance on classes to generate the quadtree."
